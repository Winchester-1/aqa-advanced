# 🤖 QA Automation Learning Lab

Welcome to my little lab for mastering **Automation Testing**!  
Here I experiment, break stuff, fix stuff, and learn how to make software behave (or at least pretend to).

---

## 🧠 What’s inside
- 🧩 **Manual & Automation Testing** practice  
- 🧪 **API Testing** (DevTools, Fiddler, Postman)  
- 💻 **UI Testing** experiments (Cypress / Playwright)  
- 🗂️ **Test Cases**, **Checklists**, and **Test Plans**  
- 🧾 Notes, tips, and docs written during my QA journey  

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen my automation skills  
- Build real test projects  
- Learn best practices for test design  
- Prepare for future AQA challenges

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack
`JavaScript` • `Cypress` • `Postman` • `Git` • `Playwright`

## 🧩 Fun fact
Testing is like coffee ☕ —  
too little, and you miss the bugs;  
too much, and you start seeing them everywhere.
